# Principal-Component-Analysis
• Implemented PCA algorithm using NumPy, as well as with built-in PCA function from Scikit-learn.

• Identified top k-principal components using EigenValue Decomposition and lowered the dimensions.

• Confirmed 100% match of results obtained from custom implementation & Scikit-learn built-in function
